						Improvisers <span class='artist_name'>Justin K. Comer</span> (saxophones), <span class='artist_name'>Carlos Cotallo Solares</span> (guitar/electronics), and <span class='artist_name'>Will Yager</span> (double bass) formed Wombat in October 2017. Together they explore new sonic textures and instrumental techniques in concert halls, coffee shops, backyards, and basements. Though the performances are never planned beforehand, the trio's music is influenced by their collective experience with contemporary music, noise, jazz, metal, and drone. Recent appearances include Oh My Ears Festival (Phoenix, AZ), MOXsonic (Warrensburg, MO), the Maximum Ames festival (Ames, IA), Composers' Workshops at the University of Iowa, and the Feed Me Weird Things and iHearIC concert series.
